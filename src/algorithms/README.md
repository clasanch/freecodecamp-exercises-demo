## File Structure and Conventions

### Naming Convention

All algorithm files follow the pattern: `algorithm-name.js`

- Descriptive kebab-case naming
- Corresponding test files: `algorithm-name.test.js`
- Functions exported as default exports

### Code Organization

```
src/algorithms/
â”œâ”€â”€ algorithm-name.js          # Implementation with JSDoc
â””â”€â”€ README.md                  # This documentation

tests/algorithms/
â””â”€â”€ algorithm-name.test.js     # Comprehensive test suite
```

### Documentation Standards

Each algorithm includes:

- **Algorithm description** with mathematical background
- **Time/space complexity analysis**
- **Implementation approach** explanation
- **Usage examples** with expected outputs
- **Edge cases** and constraint handling

## Quality Metrics

### Code Quality

- **ESLint**: 0 errors/warnings
- **Prettier**: Consistent formatting
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Automated quality gates
- **CI/CD pipeline**: Full validation on every change

## Testing Approach

### Test Categories per Algorithm

1. **Function validation** - Ensures function exists and is callable
2. **Basic functionality** - Core algorithm behavior verification
3. **Edge cases** - Empty arrays, single elements, boundary conditions
4. **Data integrity** - Original array preservation, type consistency
5. **Implementation constraints** - FreeCodeCamp-specific requirements
6. **Performance validation** - Large dataset handling

### Constraint Testing

- **No built-in .sort() usage** where prohibited
- **Immutability enforcement** - original arrays untouched
- **FreeCodeCamp compliance** - exact specification adherence
- **Algorithm-specific validations** - e.g., Math.floor() usage in binary search

## Development Workflow

### TDD Cycle Applied

1. **ðŸ”´ Red**: Write failing test defining expected behavior
2. **ðŸŸ¢ Green**: Implement minimal code to pass test
3. **ðŸ”µ Refactor**: Optimize while maintaining passing tests

### Git Workflow (Trunk-Based Development)

1. Feature branch creation: `feature/algorithm-name-implementation`
2. TDD implementation with frequent commits
3. Quality validation: lint, format, test coverage
4. Pull request with comprehensive documentation
5. Squash and merge with cleanup
