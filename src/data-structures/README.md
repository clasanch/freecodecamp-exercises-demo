implemented with TDD methodology and Clean Code principles.

## Progress: 16/46 Completed

### âœ… Completed (16/46)

- [x] **Typed Arrays** (`typed-arrays.js`) - Efficient array operations for
      numeric data

      implementation
- [x] **Create a Stack Class** (`stack-class.js`) - Object-oriented Stack
      implementation
- [x] **Create a Queue Class** (`queue-class.js`) - FIFO data structure with
      enqueue/dequeue operations
- [x] **Create a Priority Queue Class** (`priority-queue-class.js`) -
      Priority-based queue where elements with lower priority numbers have
      higher precedence
- [x] **Create a Circular Queue** (`circular-queue.js`) - Fixed-size circular
      buffer with wraparound pointer logic and O(1) enqueue/dequeue operations
- [x] **Create a Set Class** (`set-class.js`) - Unique element collection with
      type-safe storage, preventing duplicates and supporting O(1) operations
      for add, remove, has, and size methods
- [x] **Perform a Union on Two Sets** (`union-two-sets.js`) - Set union
      operation that combines two sets returning all unique elements from both
      sets without duplicates, using O(n + m) time complexity
- [x] **Perform an Intersection on Two Sets** (`intersection-two-sets.js`) - Set
      intersection operation that returns only elements common to both sets,
      optimized to iterate over the smaller set with O(min(n, m)) time
      complexity and 100% test coverage
- [x] **Perform a Difference on Two Sets** (`set-difference-class.js`) - Set
      difference operation that returns elements present in the first set but
      absent in the second set, demonstrating asymmetric operation with O(n)
      time complexity and 100% test coverage
- [x] **Create and Add to Sets in ES6** (`es6-set-create-add.js`) - Native ES6
      Set usage demonstration with automatic duplicate handling and simple add()
      method, showcasing ES6 Set simplicity compared to custom ES5
      implementation with 100% test coverage
- [x] **Remove items from a set in ES6** (`remove-items-from-set.js`) - ES6 Set
      delete() method demonstration with preserved skeleton compliance, creates
      a Set with values [1,2,3,4,5] and removes 2 and 5 to return [1,3,4] with
      100% test coverage
- [x] **Use .has and .size on an ES6 Set** (`use-has-and-size-on-set.js`) -
      Demonstrates native ES6 Set methods for value checking and size retrieval
      using .has() for O(1) value existence checking and .size property for
      instant size retrieval with 100% test coverage
- [x] **Use Spread and Notes for ES5 Set() Integration**
      (`use-spread-and-notes-for-es5-set-integration.js`) - Demonstrates ES6
      spread operator to convert Set objects to arrays with educational
      implementation showing simple `[...set]` syntax for O(n) Set to Array
      conversion with 100% test coverage
- [x] **Create a Map Data Structure** (`create-map-data-structure.js`) - Custom
      Map implementation using JavaScript objects as underlying storage,
      provides key-value pair operations with O(1) access time, converts values
      to strings in array format as per FreeCodeCamp specifications with 100%
      test coverage
- [x] **Create an ES6 JavaScript Map** (`create-es6-javascript-map.js`) - Native
      ES6 Map implementation demonstrating built-in Map object functionality,
      maintains insertion order, supports any key type (objects, primitives,
      functions), provides O(1) operations for get/set/has/delete with 100% test
      coverage and comprehensive educational examples
