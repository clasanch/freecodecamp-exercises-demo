## üöß Work in Progress - Join the Pack!

> **Status**: Active development following Trunk-Based Development  
> **Progress**: 20/76 exercises completed (10 algorithms + 10 data structures)

This repository is **actively growing** with new algorithms and features being
added regularly. Like the motto says: _"Lone wolves need packs that have their
back"_ - and this pack is looking for talented developers who want to contribute
to something meaningful.

## üìö Development Methodology

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Each algorithm and data structure is developed following strict TDD:

1. **üî¥ Red**: Write test that fails
2. **üü¢ Green**: Minimum code to pass
3. **üîµ Refactor**: Improve while keeping tests green

### Clean Code Principles

- Small functions (max 20 lines)
- Descriptive and clear names
- Single level of abstraction
- SOLID principles applied
- Test coverage >= 80%

### Trunk-Based Development

- Short-lived branches (24-48h maximum)
- Mandatory continuous integration
- Pre-commit hooks that verify quality
- No long-lived branches

## üß™ Testing

### Test Structure

```bash
tests/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ algorithms/         # Algorithm tests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data-structures/    # Data structure tests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ projects/          # Project tests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/             # Utility tests
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ setup.js           # Global configuration
```

### Testing Conventions

- Each function/class has its `.test.js` file
- Descriptive tests with Given-When-Then
- Coverage >= 80% global, >= 90% for critical algorithms
- Performance testing for complex algorithms
